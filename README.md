# Goodies
Little things I wrote.

- `irg`: interactive ripgrep. Not very creative, I took it from the `fzf `docs.
- `qman`: manage QEMU VM lifecycle. Rather opinionated. Comes with bash completion support
- `zv`: Tiny wrapper around the ZoHo CLI because it's garbage.
- `lsvault`: List secrets in ZoHo, and read one or more of them. Good for interactive use. 
- `catvault`: Read a single secret from ZoHo. Good for scripts.

### qman
- instead of user ssh key, generate one per env, save in config, and use with `qman ssh` command
